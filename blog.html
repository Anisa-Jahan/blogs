        <h3>1. What is difference of var, let and const?</h3>
        <p>In javascript user cann declare a variable by using three keywords, var, let and const. Threre are some difference among them.</p>

        <p>Var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in js. The scope of the var keyword is the global scope or funvtion scope that's mean variable defined outside the function can be accessed globally.</p>

        <p>Let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword. The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It can't be accessable outside the particular block.</p>

        <p>Const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword except the user can't update it. When user declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise it returns error. User can't update the const variable once it is declared.</p>
